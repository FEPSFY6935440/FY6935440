The developed world is shifting away from petrol/diesel vehicles & towards clean transport in hopes of fulfilling Paris Agreement obligations & curbing air pollution in dense cities. Private vehicles are the most common form of transportation worldwide, so EVs (electric vehicles) have led the way, but recent hostility to them from politicians due to Net-Zero costs puts their future in jeopardy. Hydrogen, as a fuel source can be adapted into ICEs (internal combustion engines), avoiding uncertainty and producing near-zero emissions – as done by BMW and Yamaha. In practice though, hydrogen infrastructure is more expensive than charging infrastructure (~$2m vs ~$100k per station), and the lack of mass-produced hydrogen ICEs makes a comparison to traditional ICEs impossible. Hydrogen simply is not as cost-effective as EVs, let alone petrol/diesel, and investment into hydrogen for vehicles is focused on fuel cells, not ICEs. The ICE cannot be saved by hydrogen fuel.

    <p id="Introduction_InText" class="ex2">
The future of fossil-fuel powered combustion engines is looking bleaker than ever. Countries are moving towards EVs and introducing stricter environmental standards and legislature, but there has been a rise in anti-Net-Zero sentiments by people and governments. By looking into why EVs aren’t being widely adopted and accepted, and the impact of fossil-fuel ICEs on air quality and air pollution, the case of hydrogen to be an attractive and clean alternative will be discussed by looking at attempts, like the BMW Hydrogen 7, or Yamaha’s 5.0 litre V8 engine commissioned by Toyota . In addition to this, the infrastructure and investment needed will be assessed and whether it is cost-effective and viable in comparison to electric and charging infrastructure.

    <p id="Why Is Another Clean Alternative to EVs Needed?" class="ex1">
Opposition to climate action by UK newspapers have reached record highs (42 editorials against climate action in 2023 vs <5 in 2020). The [promised] reversal of environmental-friendly policies have surged by governments across the world. Examples of this include; the current Trump administration in the US reversing a 2021 executive order aiming for 50% of new vehicles sold to be EVs, or the high-polling ReformUK party stating they would scrap the 2050 UK Net-Zero emissions target, or the AfD party in Germany claiming they would try to roll back EU EV policies). This presents a volatile future for EVs and a market segment that relies on subsidies and government incentives if it wants to be seen as a viable and competitive alternative to diesel or petrol cars to increase adoption.
This stems from the fact that EVs consumer habits and usage patterns are different since charging the battery to a satisfactory level requires a much more prolonged period compared to filling up the tank of an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) car. To accommodate this and compensate for the convenience loss of quickly refuelling an ICE car, houses and residential/commercial parking need to be retrofitted with chargers and charging infrastructure should be in similar abundance to petrol stations. However, this becomes much more difficult to achieve with inconsistent and uncertain investment into the required infrastructure to make it plausible for the average person to reliably use an EV without worry, let alone convince hesitant ICE car owners to make the switch to a technology that does not present many convincing upfront apparent benefits – bar the fact that charging an EV is cheaper than refuelling a car to full capacity if done at home. But even then, EVs are more expensive upfront compared to their ICE counterparts making them seem less attractive unless consumers are incentivised by policies and 
A dilemma becomes rather apparent. EVs are being pushed into the market, but inadequate infrastructure, a changing political climate, and consumer hesitation prevents widespread adoption, yet humanity needs to move away from more CO2, NOX, and SO2 being released into the atmosphere in a bid to clean the air in cities and reduce global warming. 
Road vehicles are the main source of air pollution in Delhi, and 12,000 deaths per year in Delhi being attributed to air pollution, and while a shift is underway (aiming for 25% of new vehicles sold to be EVs by 2024), there has been no data released to support whether the target was met. With the average income being $4,386.57/year for 2021-2022 (INR-USD exchange rate from 30/10/2025), and an entry-level EV being in the ~$4,000-$15,0000, there is reason to believe that EV adoption has not managed to achieve the target set.
