        The developed world is shifting away from petrol/diesel vehicles and towards clean transport in hopes of fulfilling Paris Agreement obligations and curbing air pollution in dense cities. Private vehicles are the most common form of transportation worldwide, so EVs (electric vehicles) have led the way, but recent hostility to them from politicians due to Net-Zero costs puts their future in jeopardy. Hydrogen, as a fuel source can be adapted into ICEs (internal combustion engines), avoiding uncertainty and being producing near-zero emissions – as done by BMW and Yamaha. In practice though, hydrogen infrastructure is more expensive than charging infrastructure (~$2m vs ~ $100k per station), and the lack of mass-produced hydrogen ICEs make a comparison to traditional ICEs impossible. Hydrogen simply is not as cost-effective as EVs, let alone petrol/diesel, and investment into hydrogen for vehicles are as fuel cells, and not ICEs. The ICE cannot be saved by hydrogen fuel.

        The future of fossil-fuel powered combustion engines is looking bleaker than ever. Countries are moving towards EVs and introducing stricter environmental standards and legislature, but there has been a rise in anti-Net-Zero sentiments by people and governments. By looking into why EVs aren’t being widely adopted and accepted, and the impact of fossil-fuel ICEs on air quality and air pollution, the case of hydrogen to be an attractive and clean alternative will be discussed by looking at attempts, like the BMW Hydrogen 7, or Yamaha’s 5.0 litre V8 engine commissioned by Toyota . In addition to this, the infrastructure and investment needed will be assessed and whether it is cost-effective and viable in comparison to electric and charging infrastructure.
