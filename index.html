      The developed world is shifting away from petrol/diesel vehicles and towards clean transport in hopes of fulfilling Paris Agreement obligations and curbing air pollution in dense cities. Private vehicles are the most common form of transportation worldwide, so EVs (electric vehicles) have led the way, but recent hostility to them from politicians due to Net-Zero costs puts their future in jeopardy. Hydrogen, as a fuel source can be adapted into ICEs (internal combustion engines), avoiding uncertainty and being producing near-zero emissions – as done by BMW and Yamaha. In practice though, hydrogen infrastructure is more expensive than charging infrastructure (~$2m vs ~ $100k per station), and the lack of mass-produced hydrogen ICEs make a comparison to traditional ICEs impossible. Hydrogen simply is not as cost-effective as EVs, let alone petrol/diesel, and investment into hydrogen for vehicles are as fuel cells, and not ICEs. The ICE cannot be saved by hydrogen fuel.
